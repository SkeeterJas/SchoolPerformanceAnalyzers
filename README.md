A set of simple python scripts which is designed to examine State-provided data sets on public school performance.
This is meant to be useful for parents, educators, and politicians who might use this data to design a more effective
educational system. Those schools which are chronic overachievers should be rewarded, and their teaching practices mirrored
in other educational programs throughout the state and even country.

top_schools_report_out_v1.py  <name of .xlxs file to analyze>
Purpose: Analyze Oregon State-provided educational testing and proficiency results, then report out the top 10 performing schools and their performance in each category of High Schools, Middle Schools, and Elementary Schools.

'compare_top_schools.py', <name of earlier .xlxs file> <name of later .xlxs file>
The first spreadsheet is used to identify the top performing schools.
The second spreadsheet is used to look up those schools, and see how they did in this later assessment.
Trends are reported and changes noted.
